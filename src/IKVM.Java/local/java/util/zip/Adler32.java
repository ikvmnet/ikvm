/**
 * Computes Adler32 checksum for a stream of data. An Adler32 
 * checksum is not as reliable as a CRC32 checksum, but a lot faster to 
 * compute.
 *<p>
 * The specification for Adler32 may be found in RFC 1950.
 * (ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification version 3.3)
 *<p>
 *<p>
 * From that document:
 *<p>
 *      "ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum)
 *       This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed data
 *       (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32
 *       algorithm. This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement
 *       of the Fletcher algorithm, used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073
 *       standard. 
 *<p>
 *       Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: s1 is
 *       the sum of all bytes, s2 is the sum of all s1 values. Both sums
 *       are done modulo 65521. s1 is initialized to 1, s2 to zero.  The
 *       Adler-32 checksum is stored as s2*65536 + s1 in most-
 *       significant-byte first (network) order."
 *<p>
 * "8.2. The Adler-32 algorithm
 *<p>
 *    The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet
 *    still provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
 *<p>
 *    The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552
 *    bytes, so the modulo operation time is negligible.  If the bytes
 *    are a, b, c, the second sum is 3a + 2b + c + 3, and so is position
 *    and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is just a
 *    checksum.  That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible
 *    large class of two-byte errors that leave the check unchanged.
 *    (The Fletcher checksum uses 255, which is not prime and which also
 *    makes the Fletcher check insensitive to single byte changes 0 <->
 *    255.)
 *<p>
 *    The sum s1 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length
 *    of the sequence part of s2, so that the length does not have to be
 *   checked separately. (Any sequence of zeroes has a Fletcher
 *    checksum of zero.)"
