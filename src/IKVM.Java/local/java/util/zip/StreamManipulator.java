/**
 * This class allows us to retrieve a specified amount of bits from
 * the input buffer, as well as copy big byte blocks.
 *
 * It uses an int buffer to store up to 31 bits for direct
 * manipulation.  This guarantees that we can get at least 16 bits,
 * but we only need at most 15, so this is all safe.
 *
 * There are some optimizations in this class, for example, you must
 * never peek more then 8 bits more than needed, and you must first 
 * peek bits before you may drop them.  This is not a general purpose
 * class but optimized for the behaviour of the Inflater.
