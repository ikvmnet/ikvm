	 * UniverseOptions:
	 *
	 *   None
	 *		Default behavior, most compatible with System.Reflection[.Emit]
	 *
	 *   EnableFunctionPointers
	 *		Normally function pointers in signatures are replaced by System.IntPtr
	 *		(for compatibility with System.Reflection), when this option is enabled
	 *		they are represented as first class types (Type.__IsFunctionPointer will
	 *		return true for them).
	 *
	 *   DisableFusion
	 *      Don't use native Fusion API to resolve assembly names.
	 *
	 *   DisablePseudoCustomAttributeRetrieval
	 *      Set this option to disable the generaton of pseudo-custom attributes
	 *      when querying custom attributes.
	 *
	 *   DontProvideAutomaticDefaultConstructor
	 *      Normally TypeBuilder, like System.Reflection.Emit, will provide a default
	 *      constructor for types that meet the requirements. By enabling this
	 *      option this behavior is disabled.
	 *
	 *   MetadataOnly
	 *      By default, when a module is read in, the stream is kept open to satisfy
	 *      subsequent lazy loading. In MetadataOnly mode only the metadata is read in
	 *      and after that the stream is closed immediately. Subsequent lazy loading
	 *      attempts will fail with an InvalidOperationException.
	 *      APIs that are not available is MetadataOnly mode are:
	 *      - Module.ResolveString()
	 *      - Module.GetSignerCertificate()
	 *      - Module.GetManifestResourceStream()
	 *      - Module.__ReadDataFromRVA()
	 *      - MethodBase.GetMethodBody()
	 *      - FieldInfo.__GetDataFromRVA()
	 *
	 *   DeterministicOutput
	 *      The generated output file will depend only on the input. In other words,
	 *      the PE file header time stamp will be set to zero and the module version
	 *      id will be based on a SHA1 of the contents, instead of a random guid.
	 *      This option can not be used in combination with PDB file generation.
